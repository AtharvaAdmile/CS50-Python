# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python-Problem Sets
Welcome to my CS50 Python journey! This repository contains my solutions to Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python course problem sets.

# üìö About CS50 Python:

CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python is Harvard University's introduction to programming using Python. The course covers fundamental programming concepts including:

- Functions and variables
- Conditionals and loops
- Exceptions and debugging
- File I/O and libraries
- Unit testing
- Object-oriented programming
- Regular expressions

# üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure:

- [Week 0: Functions, Variables](week0/)
- [Week 2: Loops](week2/)
- [Week 3: Exceptions](week3/)
- [Week 4: Libraries](week4/)
- [Week 5: Unit Tests](week5/)
- [Week 6: File I/O](week6/)
- [Week 7: Regular Expressions](week7/)
- [Week 8: Object-Oriented Programming](week8/)
- [Week 9: Et Cetera (Final Project)](Final%20project/)

üìã Problem Sets Completed

 Week 0 - Functions: Basic function creation and usage
 
 Week 1 - Conditionals: If statements and logical operators
 
 Week 2 - Loops: For and while loops
 
 Week 3 - Exceptions: Error handling and debugging
 
 Week 4 - Libraries: Working with Python libraries
 
 Week 5 - Unit Tests: Writing and running tests
 
 Week 6 - File I/O: Reading and writing files
 
 Week 7 - Regular Expressions: Pattern matching
 
 Week 8 - Object-Oriented Programming: Classes and objects
 
 Final Project: Capstone programming project

# üöÄ How to Run

Each problem set contains individual Python files that can be run directly:

``` python3 problem_name.py ```
Some problems may require additional input files or command line arguments. Check individual problem directories for specific instructions.

# üéØ Learning Objectives
Through these problem sets, I'm developing skills in:

- Problem decomposition and algorithmic thinking

- Python syntax and best practices

- Debugging and testing strategies

- Code documentation and readability

- Software design principles
